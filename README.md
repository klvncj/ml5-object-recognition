# Object Recognition with ML5 COCO-SSD

This repository contains code for object recognition using the ML5 COCO-SSD object detection model. The ML5 COCO-SSD model is a pre-trained deep learning model that can detect and classify objects in images and videos.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have a modern web browser that supports JavaScript and access to the internet. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-recognition.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Click on the "Select File" button to choose an image or video file.

4. The ML5 COCO-SSD model will process the file and display the detected objects along with their respective confidence scores.

5. You can adjust the confidence threshold for object detection by modifying the `confidenceThreshold` variable in the `script.js` file. The default threshold is set to `0.5`, but you can experiment with different values.

## Customization

If you want to use a different pre-trained object detection model or modify the code to suit your specific requirements, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Download the desired pre-trained model from the [ML5 Model Zoo](https://ml5js.org/docs/quick-start#loading-pre-trained-models) or train your own model using TensorFlow.

2. Replace the ML5 COCO-SSD model with your chosen model in the `script.js` file. Make sure to update the model loading code and the object detection logic accordingly.

3. Customize the HTML and CSS files to modify the user interface and styling according to your preference.

4. Test your changes by running the code and verifying the object detection results.
